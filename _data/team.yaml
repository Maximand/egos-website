  bio: "Carlos is an Internet security researcher with a background in information security and governance. His research focuses on understanding and improving the Internet for everyone, with particular emphasis on security aspects. Most recently, Carlos has worked on global-scale measurement of Internet service deployments and their security, data-driven security mechanisms, and the analysis of emerging technologies and their implications.
  
  Carlos approaches his work through the lens of real-world impact. The technology itself is not always what matters—it is its embedding in society that makes it meaningful. For this reason, he collaborates across disciplines and with industry to help make the Internet a safer, more secure, and ultimately more useful and interesting place.
  
  In addition to his research on Internet security, Carlos is dedicated to using his skills and expertise to make a positive impact on the world. He believes that everyone has the right to use the Internet safely and securely, and he is committed to advancing this goal through his research and collaborations.
  
  Carlos’s work employs global-scale measurements and data-driven security mechanisms to study the deployment and security of Internet services. He also examines the implications of emerging technologies on the Internet. Whether conducting measurement studies or analyzing technological trends, Carlos always strives to find practical solutions that can improve the Internet for all users."
